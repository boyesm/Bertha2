## Contributing

* identify what you're working on in the GitHub projects tab. each component has its own Projects tab, add/move something to the "In Progress" tab when work is started
* when working on a new feature, create a new sub-branch of the appropriate component branch
* run the appropriate tests before creating a pull request to merge your branch with the branch below it
* when a component version in complete, create a PR to merge it with dev-branch. from there, integration with other components will be tested, then is will be merged with main.
