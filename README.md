# Bertha2

Bertha2 is a hardware device that uses linear actuators to play the piano. It's essentially an external player piano.
Here's a video that shows the device in action:

On top of the hardware platform, we've built an integration with Twitch.tv. The idea is that we can livestream the device,
and viewers can control what is being played.

* Ensure the latest firmware is loaded onto the Arduino
* Install FFmpeg using `brew install ffmpeg`
* Ensure al dependencies are installed and up to date. Reference `requirements.txt` for more information.
* Install the latest version of pytube by using `git clone git://github.com/nficano/pytube.git`. Anything else than the latest version will likely cause errors.
