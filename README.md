# Bertha2

Bertha2 is a livestreamed player piano that integrates with Twitch. Twitch viewers submit links to YouTube videos, the audio from these videos is converted into MIDI and automatically played on the player piano.

**Before running, install the latest version of pytube!**


# Setup

* Load firmware onto Arduino
* Install FFmpeg




# TODO
* [done?] MIDI Files aren't playing long enough. They're playing too fast.
* Next Up: has the currently playing video as 1.
* When videos are over, current video still says it's playing the video that's done.
